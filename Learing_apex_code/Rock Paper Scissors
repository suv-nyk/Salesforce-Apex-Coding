Q- Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock. Implement the method rockPaperScissors 
   that takes as parameters two strings player1 and player2 representing the moves played by player 1 and player 2, 
   valid moves being 'rock', 'paper', and 'scissors'. Return 1 if player 1 wins, 2 if player 2 wins, and 0 if no one wins.
   rockPaperScissors('rock', 'paper') = 2
   rockPaperScissors('scissors', 'paper') = 1
   rockPaperScissors('paper', 'paper') = 0


public Integer rockPaperScissors(String player1, String player2) {
    //code here
    //Check if both players made the same move
    if (player1 == player2) {
        return 0;
    }
    //Detemine the winner based on the rules of the game
    else if((player1 == 'rock' && player2 == 'scissors') || (player1 == 'scissors' && player2 == 'paper') || (player1 == 'paper' && player2 == 'rock'))
    {
        return 1;
    }
    else {
        return 2;
    }
}
