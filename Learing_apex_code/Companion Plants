Some plants are considered companion plants. They grow better when planted next to each other. For the purpose of this problem, 
we consider the following plants to be companions: lettuce and cucumbers, lettuce and onions, onions and carrots, and onions 
and tomatoes.
Write a function isCompanion that takes as input two strings plant1 and plant2. 
If the two plants are companion plants based on the criteria described above, return true. Otherwise, return false.
companionPlants('onions', 'lettuce') = true
companionPlants('lettuce', 'tomatoes') = false


public Boolean companionPlants(String plant1, String plant2) {
    //code here
    //Define the companion plant pairs
    Set<String> companions = new Set<String> {
        'lettuce-cucumbers',
        'lettuce-onions',
        'onions-carrots',
        'onions-tomatoes'
    };
    //Create the pairs in both possible orders
    String pair1 = plant1 + '-' + plant2;
    String pair2= plant2 + '-' + plant1;


    //Check if either pair is in the set of companions
    return companions.contains(pair1) || companions.contains(pair2);
}
